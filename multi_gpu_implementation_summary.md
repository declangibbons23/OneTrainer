# Multi-GPU Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented multi-GPU training support for OneTrainer using PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) framework. This implementation allows users to utilize multiple GPUs for faster training of diffusion models.

## Key Components

1. **Configuration**
   - Added multi-GPU properties to TrainConfig class
   - Implemented proper parsing of multi-GPU settings from JSON configs
   - Added learning rate scaling option for multi-GPU training

2. **User Interface**
   - Added MultiGPUFrame to the training tab in the UI
   - Implemented settings for backend selection, distributed data loading, and more
   - Added tooltips explaining each option

3. **Training Scripts**
   - Created specialized DistributedTrainer class that extends BaseTrainer
   - Implemented train_multi_gpu.py for command-line multi-GPU training
   - Added support for both torchrun and torch.multiprocessing.spawn launch methods

4. **Launch Scripts**
   - Created start-multi-gpu.sh for Linux/macOS users
   - Created start-multi-gpu.bat for Windows users
   - Ensured proper environment setup for distributed training

5. **Utilities**
   - Implemented distributed_util.py with helper functions for DDP
   - Added GPU detection and environment variable management
   - Created proper clean-up procedures for distributed processes

6. **Diagnostics and Documentation**
   - Created check_multi_gpu.py script for system diagnostics
   - Added comprehensive documentation in docs/MultiGPUTraining.md
   - Created start-multi-gpu-help.md with usage instructions

## Implementation Details

### Distributed Environment Setup
- Used PyTorch's distributed package for process group initialization
- Implemented both NCCL (recommended for NVIDIA GPUs) and GLOO backends
- Set up proper rank and world size management

### Model Handling
- Wrapped models in DistributedDataParallel for efficient gradient synchronization
- Ensured model parameters are properly transferred to the correct device
- Maintained model saving only on the main process (rank 0)

### Data Loading
- Added optional distributed data loading with DistributedSampler
- Ensured proper data sharding across processes
- Set proper worker initialization for multi-process data loading

### Learning Rate Scaling
- Implemented optional linear learning rate scaling based on world size
- Added safety checks for gradient accumulation with multi-GPU

## Testing and Validation
- Tested with multiple GPU configurations
- Verified proper gradient synchronization across devices
- Confirmed saving and loading works correctly
- Validated that distributed training produces equivalent results to single-GPU training

## Limitations and Future Work
- All GPUs should be of the same model for optimal performance
- Some advanced optimization techniques may require additional tuning
- Future work may include FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) for larger models
- GLOO backend performance may be improved in the future
