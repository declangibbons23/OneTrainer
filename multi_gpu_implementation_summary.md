# Multi-GPU Training Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds distributed training support to OneTrainer using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP). The implementation allows users to train models across multiple GPUs for faster training times.

## Components Implemented

1. **Distributed Utilities**: `modules/util/distributed_util.py`
   - Core functions for distributed setup, cleanup, and coordination

2. **Configuration**: Extended `TrainConfig` in `modules/util/config/TrainConfig.py`
   - Added multi-GPU specific settings like backend, world size, etc.

3. **UI Component**: `modules/ui/MultiGPUFrame.py`
   - User interface for configuring multi-GPU training options
   - Integrated into all training UIs via `TrainingTab.py`

4. **Distributed Trainer**: `modules/trainer/DistributedTrainer.py`
   - Extended base trainer with distributed functionality
   - Handles process coordination and synchronization

5. **Launch Scripts**:
   - `start-multi-gpu.bat` (Windows)
   - `start-multi-gpu.sh` (Linux/macOS)

6. **Training Script**: `scripts/train_multi_gpu.py`
   - Main entry point for multi-GPU training
   - Handles process spawning and coordination

7. **Documentation**: `docs/MultiGPUTraining.md`
   - User guide for multi-GPU training

## Features Implemented

- GPU count detection and validation
- Support for both `torchrun` and `torch.multiprocessing.spawn` launchers
- Configurable distributed backend (NCCL, Gloo)
- Automatic learning rate scaling
- Distributed data loading
- Process synchronization and barrier management
- UI integration for easy configuration
- Documentation and command-line tools

## Future Enhancements

The following enhancements could be added in the future:

1. **Multi-Node Training**:
   - Extend for training across multiple machines
   - Add options for node rank and address configuration

2. **Mixed Precision Training**:
   - Integrate with PyTorch AMP for memory efficiency
   - Support for gradient scaling in distributed setting

3. **Gradient Accumulation**:
   - Better integration with distributed training
   - Per-GPU batch size configuration

4. **Model Checkpointing**:
   - Distributed checkpointing for large models
   - Support for zero redundancy optimizer (ZeRO)

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - GPU utilization tracking
   - Inter-GPU communication monitoring

6. **Advanced Topologies**:
   - Pipeline parallelism
   - Tensor parallelism for very large models

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the following configurations:
- 2-4 NVIDIA GPUs on a single machine
- Stable Diffusion 3 model with LoRA training
- Both `torchrun` and `multiprocessing.spawn` launchers

## Usage

Users can access multi-GPU training in two ways:
1. Via the UI using the new Multi-GPU panel in the training interface
2. Via command line using the provided scripts: `start-multi-gpu.bat` or `start-multi-gpu.sh`
