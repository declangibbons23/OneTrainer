# Multi-GPU Training Fixes (Final Update)

## Issues Fixed

1. **GUI Not Launching Multi-GPU Training Properly**
   - Problem: The UI would not properly launch multi-GPU training even when the option was enabled
   - Fix: Completely rewrote the multi-GPU initialization to use torch.multiprocessing.spawn directly

2. **Command Line Parsing Errors in Launch Scripts**
   - Problem: Both Bash and Batch scripts had issues with argument parsing
   - Fix: Replaced direct command execution with embedded Python scripts

3. **Configuration and Process Management**
   - Problem: The previous approach with temporary config files was error-prone
   - Fix: Direct passing of configuration objects between processes

## Key Changes

1. **TrainUI.py**
   - Completely rewrote the multi-GPU training initialization
   - Now uses torch.multiprocessing.spawn directly in the UI thread
   - Properly handles rank and process group initialization
   - Passes the training callbacks and commands only to the main process

2. **start-multi-gpu.sh and start-multi-gpu.bat**
   - Both scripts now create embedded Python code to handle the launch
   - Avoids all shell command parsing issues by using Python directly
   - Works identically on both Linux/macOS and Windows

3. **Distributed Training Architecture**
   - The main process (rank 0) now handles UI callbacks
   - All processes properly initialize their own CUDA devices
   - Process group setup happens consistently across all methods

## How It Works Now

1. **When using the UI:**
   - When the user enables multi-GPU training and clicks Start Training:
   - torch.multiprocessing.spawn launches N processes (one per GPU)
   - Each process initializes a distributed environment with its own rank
   - The training is synchronized across all GPUs using DDP

2. **When using command-line scripts:**
   - The scripts generate and execute Python code directly
   - This avoids all command-line parsing issues
   - The same distributed training code is used as with the UI

## Testing Instructions

1. **From the UI**:
   - Enable the "Multi-GPU Training" option in the Training tab
   - Configure other settings as needed (backend, distributed data loading, etc.)
   - Click "Start Training" - it should now properly utilize all GPUs

2. **From Command Line**:
   - Run `./start-multi-gpu.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `start-multi-gpu.bat` (Windows)
   - Follow the prompts to specify the config file and other options
